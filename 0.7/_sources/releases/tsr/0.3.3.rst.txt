.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.3.3`_

What's new in tsr 0.3.3
=======================

Queue
-----

    * Add an option to use Redis instead of beanstalkd for work queue

In order to use Redis, you need to change the configuration file:

.. highlight:: yaml

::

    queue: redis
    redis-queue:
      host: "localhost"
      port: 6379
      db: 4
      password: "your-password"

All settings are optional (``queue`` will still default to "beanstalkd"), refer
to :doc:`configuration docs </reference/config>` for more details.

Other improvements and bugfixes
-------------------------------

    * Do not depend on Docker code
    * Improve the layout of the documentation
    * Fix multiple data races in tests
