Segregate Scheduler
+++++++++++++++++++

Overview
========

tsuru uses schedulers to chooses which node an unit should be deployed. There are
two schedulers: `round robin` and `segregate scheduler`.

The default one is `round robin`, this page describes what the `segregate
scheduler` does and how to enable it.

How it works
============

Segregate scheduler is a scheduler that segregates the units between nodes by
team.

First, what you need to do is to define a relation between a pool and teams. After
that you need to register nodes with the ``pool`` metadata information, indicating
to which pool the node belongs.

When deploying an application, the scheduler will choose among the nodes with the
pool metadata information associated to the team owning the application being
deployed.

Configuration and setup
-----------------------

To use the `segregate scheduler` you need to enable the segregate mode in
``tsuru.conf``:

.. highlight:: yaml

::

    docker:
      segregate: true


Adding a pool
-------------

Using `tsuru-admin` you create a pool:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-add pool1

Adding teams to a pool
-----------------------

You can add one or more teams at once.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-teams-add pool1 team1 team2

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-teams-add pool2 team3

Listing a pool
--------------

To list pools you do:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-list
    +-------+-------------+
    | Pools | Teams       |
    +-------+-------------+
    | pool1 | team1 team2 |
    | pool2 | team3       |
    +-------+-------------+

Registering a node with pool metadata
-------------------------------------

You can use the ``tsuru-admin`` with ``docker-node-add`` to register or create
nodes with the pool metadata:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru-admin docker-node-add --register address=http://localhost:4243 pool=pool1


Removing a pool
---------------

To remove a pool you do:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-remove pool1


Removing teams from a pool
--------------------------

You can remove one or more teams at once.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-teams-remove pool1 team1

    $ tsuru-admin docker-pool-teams-remove pool1 team1 team2 team3
