What's new in tsuru 0.11.0
==========================

* Add the flag ``-t/--team-owner`` to the ``service-add`` command. This flag is
  used to specify the team that owns a service instance (related to the issue
  `#698 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/698>`_)
* Improve plugin handling, now plugins written to tsuru will get the following
  environment variables (related to issue `#863
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/863>`_):

    - ``TSURU_TARGET``: the current target defined in the tsuru client, it's the
      address of the tsuru server, to which the plugin should send requests, using
      the new service proxy endpoint;

    - ``TSURU_TOKEN``: token used to authenticate with the tsuru API.
* Include the team owner in the ``app-info`` output

Bug fixes
=========
