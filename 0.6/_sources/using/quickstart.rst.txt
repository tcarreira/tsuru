Building your app in tsuru
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

tsuru is an open source polyglot cloud application platform. With tsuru, you
don't need to think about servers at all. You can write apps in the programming
language of your choice, back it with add-on resources such as SQL and NoSQL
databases, memcached, redis, and many others. You manage your app using the
tsuru command-line tool and you deploy code using the Git revision control
system, all running on the tsuru infrastructure.
