Installing tsuru clients
++++++++++++++++++++++++

tsuru contains three clients: ``tsuru``, ``tsuru-admin`` and ``crane``.

* **tsuru** is the command line utility used by application developers, that
  will allow users to create, list, bind and manage apps. For more details,
  check :doc:`tsuru usage </reference/tsuru-client>`;
* **crane** is used by service administrators. For more detail, check
  :doc:`crane usage </reference/services>`;
* **tsuru-admin** is used by cloud administrators. Whoever is allowed to use
  it has gotten super powers :-)

This document describes how you can install those clients, using pre-compiled
binaries or building them from source.

`Using homebrew (Mac OS X only)`_

`Using the PPA (Ubuntu only)`_

`Using AUR (ArchLinux only)`_

`Build from source (Linux and Mac OS X)`_

Using homebrew (Mac OS X only)
==============================

If you use Mac OS X and `homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_, you may
use a custom tap to install ``tsuru``, ``crane`` and ``tsuru-admin``. First you
need to add the tap:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ brew tap tsuru/homebrew-tsuru

Now you can install tsuru, tsuru-admin and crane:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ brew install tsuru
    $ brew install tsuru-admin
    $ brew install crane

Whenever a new version of any of tsuru's clients is out, you can just run:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade <formula> # tsuru/tsuru-admin/crane

For more details on taps, check `homebrew documentation
<https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap>`_.

**NOTE:** tsuru requires Go 1.2 or higher. Make sure you have the last version
of Go installed in your system.

Using the PPA (Ubuntu only)
===========================

Ubuntu users can install tsuru clients using ``apt-get`` and the `tsuru PPA
<https://launchpad.net/~tsuru/+archive/ppa>`_. You'll need to add the PPA
repository locally and run an ``apt-get update``:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tsuru/ppa
    $ sudo apt-get update

Now you can install tsuru's clients:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ sudo apt-get install tsuru
    $ sudo apt-get install crane
    $ sudo apt-get install tsuru-admin

Using AUR (ArchLinux only)
==========================

Archlinux users can build and install tsuru client from AUR repository,
Is needed to have installed `yaourt <http://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en>`_ program.

You can run:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ yaourt -S tsuru

Build from source (Linux and Mac OS X)
======================================

.. note::

    If you're feeling adventurous, you can try it on other systems, like
    FreeBSD, OpenBSD or even Windows. Please let us know about your progress!

`tsuru's source <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru>`_ is written in `Go
<http://golang.org>`_, so before installing tsuru from source, please make sure
you have `installed and configured Go <http://golang.org/doc/install>`_.

With Go installed and configured, you can use ``go get`` to install any of
tsuru's clients:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ go get github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client/tsuru
    $ go get github.com/tsuru/tsuru-admin
    $ go get github.com/tsuru/crane
