Roadmap
-------

Release Process
===============

We use GitHub's milestones to releases' planning and anyone is free to
suggest an issue to a milestone, and discuss about any issue in the next tsuru
release. We also have internal goals as listed bellow and our focus will be on
these goals. But they are not immutable, we can change any goal at any time as
community need.

At globo.com, we have goals by quarter of a year (short term goals bellow), but
it doesn't mean that there's only one release per quarter. Our releases have
one or more main issues and minor issues which can be minor bugfixes, ground
work issue and other "not so important but needed" issues.

You can suggest any issue to any milestones at any time, and we'll
discuss it in the issue or in `Gitter <https://gitter.im/tsuru/tsuru>`_.
