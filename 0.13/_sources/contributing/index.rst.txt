Development environment
=======================

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    coding-style
    vagrant

See this guide to :doc:`to setup a development environment using Vagrant </contributing/vagrant>`.

And follow our :doc:`coding style guide </contributing/coding-style>`.

Running the tests
=================

You can use `make` to install all tsuru dependencies and run tests. It will also check if everything is ok with your `GOPATH` setup:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ make

Please ensure that MongoDB and Redis are started before running the test suite. If you see some test failures with messages like "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6379: connection refused" and "no reachable server", the most likely reason is that these services are not running.

If you just want to run the tests you can use `make test`.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ make test

============

tsuru documentation is written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_,
which uses `RST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

.. highlight:: bash
