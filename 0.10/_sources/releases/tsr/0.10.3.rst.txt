tsr 0.10.3 release notes
========================

Welcome to tsr 0.10.3!

tsr 0.10.3 includes some bug fixes and improvements to the server:

* fix the distribution of containers across nodes when running ``tsuru-admin
  containers-rebalance``.
* fix a data race in connection management in the Hipache router.
* fix the behavior of ``tsuru-admin containers-rebalance --dry``. Now it
  really supports running in dry-mode.
* fix leak of connections between tsr API and docker-registry.
* removed the check for Gandalf API in configuration, making tsr really
  independent of Gandalf.
* simplify the start-up process, adding two new commands to tsr:

    - ``migrate``, that will run migrations when upgrading tsr (issue `#1137
      <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1137>`_)
    - ``gandalf-sync``, that
      will synchronize tsuru users and applications with Gandalf users and
      repositories (issue `#1138
      <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1138>`_)
