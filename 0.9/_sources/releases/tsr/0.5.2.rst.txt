=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.5.2!

These release notes cover the `new features`_ and `bug fixes`_ you'll want to
be aware of when upgrading from tsr 0.5.1 or older
versions.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in tsr 0.5.2`_

What's new in tsr 0.5.2
=======================

Improvements
============

* improve the Docker cluster management so it keeps track of which node
  contains a certain image, so a request to remove an image from the cluster
  can be sent only to the proper nodes (`docker-cluster #22
  <https://github.com/tsuru/docker-cluster/issues/22>`_).
* improve error handling on OAuth authentication

Bug fixes
=========

* Check if node exists before excludind it (mongo doesn't return an error if I
  try to remove a node which not exists from a pool) (`#840
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/840>`_).
* Fix race condition in unit-remove that prevented the command from removing
  the requested number of units
* Fix app lock management in unit-remove
