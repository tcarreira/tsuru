.. _new-1.8.1:

New features
============

Read groups from oauth provider and allow roles to groups (`#2419 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/pull/2419>`_)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change makes it possible to assign roles to groups. Groups are entities that the auth provider dynamically set on each user and which tsuru has no control over.

Example of a possible use: tsuru role-assign team-member group:mygroup teamX
This means that every user belonging to group mygroup (according to information by the auth provider) will now have the role team-member with context value of teamX.
