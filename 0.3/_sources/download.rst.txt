Client binaries
===============

tsuru clients are also distributed in binary version, so you can just download
an executable and put them somewhere in your ``PATH``.

It's important to note that all binaries are platform dependent. Currently, we
provide each of them in three flavors:

#. **darwin_amd64**: This is Mac OS X, 64 bits. Make sure the command ``uname -ms``
   prints "Darwin x86_64", otherwise this binary will not work in your system;
#. **linux_386**: This is Linux, 32 bits. Make sure the command ``uname -ms``
   prints "Linux x86", otherwise this binary will not work in your system;
#. **linux_amd64**: This is Linux, 64 bits. Make sure the command ``uname -ms``
   prints "Linux x86_64", otherwise this binary will not work in your system.

Below are the links to the binaries, you can just download, extract the archive
and put the binary somewhere in your PATH:
